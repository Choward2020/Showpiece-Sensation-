          " I am creative, open-minded and always ready for a challenge. I am goal orientated; meaning if there is a task at hand I'll take the proper steps such as planning, revising and taking action to achieve anything I am put up to.
          As the middle of eight children in my family I have been able to learn to adapt, observe and not make mistakes as the other siblings have.
          Persuing a path in web development has always been dwelling in my mind since I took computer courses in high school. Working in my past career, as a healthcare worker,
          has prepared me with traits such as: patience, time management, communication skills and many other strong qualities to accomplish any task at hand. I am excited to start a new career opportunity with web development and to see 
          what the world of tech has to offer!"
